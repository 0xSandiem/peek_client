# Contributing to Peek Client

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xSandiem/peek_client.git
cd peek_client
make install
cp .env.example .env
make build
make dev
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

Install pre-commit hooks to automatically check code quality before commits:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Run hooks manually on all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The hooks will automatically run Black, Flake8, isort, ESLint, and Prettier checks.

## Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
make test

# Backend tests only
make test-django

# Frontend tests only
make test-react
```

## Code Style

- Python: Black, Flake8, isort
- TypeScript: ESLint, Prettier

Check code style:
```bash
make lint
```

Auto-format code:
```bash
make format
```

## Commit Conventions

Follow Conventional Commits format:

```
feat(scope): add new feature

```

Examples:
