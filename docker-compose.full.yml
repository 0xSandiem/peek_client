# Full Stack Docker Compose
# Runs peek_client and connects to peek_api services
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. peek_api must be running: cd /path/to/peek_api && docker-compose up -d
# 2. Both projects must be on the same Docker network: peek_network
#
# Usage:
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.full.yml up -d
